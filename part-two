    Code 409 ~ returns an error stating that the requested query is missing the text property
5. {
    "text": "Caleb Ricks"
    }
    URL = https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=Caleb%20Ricks
6.  {
    "text": "Charcoal Gray"
    }
    URL = https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=570
7. https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=blue
8. Content Type & Charset = application/json; charset=utf-8
